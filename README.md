## by Sulaiman Handu



## Dataset

> Lyft operates New York Cityâ€™s Citi Bike bicycle sharing service and is committed to supporting bicycling as an alternative transportation option. As part of that commitment, Lyft makes certain Citi Bike system data available to the public. Published downloadable files of the Citi bike trip data are made available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html).
The scope of study is to analyse 2022 bike sharing data. Files containing data for each of the months in that year have been dowloaded. Data of each month will be merged to form a complete and single dataset for the year 2022. The merged dataset contains a little over 30 million rows and 13 columns. 
> Visual and programmatic assesment have been done to ensure tidiness 
> Issues with missing values and outlier removed during cleanin and dataset became ready for exploration. 

## Summary of Findings

> exploration of the 2022 data has uncovered a lot of information about citi bike sharing system. The majority of its patronage comes from annual subscribers making up 78% of its total use for the year. Most of the cyclers prefer using classic bikes to electric bikes and only the casual cyclers ride the docked bike. 

> The cycling activities generally increases during the summer time. The summer time has also been the time when the cyclers ride the bikes for more time duration. There are lesser cycling activities in winter and people who ride bikes at this time are riding for a short period. Casual rider usually patronize more during the weekend. The annual subscribers on the other hand usually patronize more during the weekdays especially on Wednesdays to Friday. 

> During the day, cycling activities begin to increase as early as 5am and continues to increase until 3pm when it starts to decrease again. 

> More focus could be placed in areas were stations have the most cyclers staring and ending their rides. Visualisation actually shows the most popular stations are the places where rides are being started and ended with W21 St and 6 Ave being the most popular of all. More strategic decisions could be taken in areas that are less popular e.g Marketing.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on just the comparison between the annual membership subscribers and the casual riders. I started by given the general statiscal ratio between the two type of membership. Then i proceed understanding what type of bike each of the group will prefer. 

> Afterwards, I introduced the calcalated variables to gain insight about timing. I was able to understand the average time it takes each membership group to complete a trip and the period that the trips are mostly prefered.
